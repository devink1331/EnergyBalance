# EnergyBalance
This repository contains project files related to research submitted to PLOS ONE. An energy balance was used to approximate evapotranspiration in controlled vegetated lysimeters. 
The excel files that are not in a date folder were used  mostly for comparing the energy balance and the mass balance results. These files also contain the raw mass balance data. 
The folder "loggernet data" contains raw meteorological data. 
The folder "MATLAB Working Folder" contains the code used to analyze the â‰ˆ1800 thermal images for each data collection day. These images can be made available upon request (email: devink1331@gmail.com). Within this folder, original code is located within "A3374". The rest of the folders are supporting code. 
The date folders contain various files pertaining to each data colleciton day, the most importat of which are excel files titled "EB...". These contain the energy balance calculations and results for each data collection day.
